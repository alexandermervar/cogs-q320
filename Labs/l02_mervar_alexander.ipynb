    "The New York Times has a Spelling Bee puzzle (https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee). These are the rules of the game: The \"hive\" is a set of 7 letters. The \"key\" is the center letter of the hive. Users can create words using only letters from the \"hive\". Words must contain at least 4 letters. Words must include the \"key\" letter. All letters can be used more than once. Write a function called bee() that receives the \"hive\" in the form of a seven letter word (e.g., \"yglpote\") where the center one \"p\" is the \"key\" and the rest of the letters are the rest of the letters in the hive. The function should read the list of all words available on Canvas and filter them to show only the ones that meet the criteria set out by the game. For the example \"hive\" given above, the function should find words like polyglot, lollypop, topology, logotype, etc. Have fun with it and make sure to show your creation to puzzle-loving family and friends!"

    "Create an object-oriented class called randomwalker() that represents an agent performing a \"drunken walk\" around a 2D space. The random walker agent will have three attributes: a position in the x dimension, a position in the y dimension, and an orientation or heading. The agent  always start at \"home,\" which is at the origin of the space (x=0, y=0). The agent has a method called step(). With every step, the agent chooses a random orientation (between 0 and 360 degrees) and takes a step in their new direction. The distance of the step is always the same - we refer to this as the velocity of the agent (let's assume for simplicity that the velocity of this agent is v=1.0). Given the current position of the agent and an orientation, one can calculate the new position using this formula: x' = x + v * cos(o) and y' = y + v * sin(o), x' and y' are the new positions, v is the agent's velocity, and o is the agent's orientation in radians (0 to 2Pi). Use the randomwalker() class that you just created to calculate, on average, how far is the random walker from home after 100 steps. To calculate the average distance, you might want to run the simulation multiple times (e.g., N=10,100,1000,..). Discuss your findings. "
